## Words for TA
#### If you're having trouble with the code on bright space, we highly recommend cloning our github repo, and to be fair, we won't commit new code after due.
## Words for everyone
#### how to use this repo:
- Run any .py files in RL_A3_policy_based, ./critic_lr, ./policy_lr. This will generate data which will be saved into ./data4plot. (At the end of every .py file as mentioned, there are some commented lines of code for plotting. Feel free to use them.)
- Go to ./plots, run any .py files in it, and it's expected to generate corresponding plots in this directory. Check them out, have fun!
